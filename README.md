===

Dynamically setup / remove prototype chain mixins.

xdy creates objects that hook up target prototype chains to store mixed-in interfaces. This way, a clear separation between the target object's members and what was mixed in is kept, allowing the mixin to be easily removed later.

How to use
----------

Read [the test suite](tests/xdy.js).
